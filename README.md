# hundred-days-of-code
One day one python code as the code will be more advanced each day.
Code cases based on Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/20741540?start=0#overview.

### Per June 23 2024
I kind of stopped code Python as I had something else that need to be focused on.
Will continue code Python again if possible.
Might use this repo as Python code cheatsheet.
